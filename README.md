Apply Sudoku rules and Crook's algorithm to solve Sudoku


The question of Sudoku should be saved in an excel file. The range of the input should be from A1 to I9. For empty cells, 0 should be input. 
After running main.py, the file path and sheet name of the excel file are asked to input. Then the result is printed, whether a solution is found or not.
